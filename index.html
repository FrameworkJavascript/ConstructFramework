<h1>Make real apps through Construct 2.</h1>
<h2>Who said C2 is just a game engine?</h2>
<hr/>
<h1>Newbies now can develop powerful apps alongside games without waiting for Eventlr to be launched.</h1>
<hr/>
<p>Download and install C2 addons, edit our boilerplate C2 project and easily build apps on top of it.</p>
<blockquote>
We understand Construct 2 is closed-source and freemium. For that purpose Eventlr is being developed for app creation, and <a href="https://gdevelop-app.com/" target="blank">GDevelop</a> is already here for game creation.
